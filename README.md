# Live Project

## Introduction
***
Toward the end of my Front-End Web Developer Bootcamp at [The Tech Academy][ta], I participated in a two-week sprint with my peers.  Our project centered on building out themed topic pages (e.g., food, travel, health, etc.) for a lifestyle brand.  I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, API, and JSON to build out a travel destination page.

Below are the [features/stories](#front-end-stories) I worked on highlighted in short representational videos.  The full code files are available in this repo.

## Front-End Stories
***
- [Structure the Page](#structure-the-page)
- [Modal and Sign-up Form](#modal-and-sign-up-form)
- [Back-to-Top Button](#back-to-top-button)
- [Dark Theme](#dark-theme)
- [Animation](#animation)
- [API Request and Response Display](#api-request-and-response-display)
- [Responsive Page](#responsive-page)

### Structure the Page
I created a page layout that had a navigation bar with anchors, a grid system (to include both text and images), and a footer.

### Create a Modal and Sign-up Form
A modal was added that contained a form to capture a user's contact information.
### Back-to-Top Button
A back-to-top button was added, and it would appear as the user scrolled toward the bottom of the page.
### Dark Theme
A toggle was added to the navigation bar to render the page in a dark theme.
### Animation
An Animation was added to one of the header elements.
### API Request and Response Display
Through user input on a button click, an API call was added to request and display current weather data from [OpenWether.org][ow]
### Responsive Page
The page was made to be responsive.

## Lessons Learned
***
 - I found it beneficial to participate in daily stand-up meetings with the team, and it was insightful to hear about what others were working on and any roadblocks they encountered.
 - The Agile methodology allowed for a consistent cadence and pace in working through the stories
 - Of course, if more time was allowed, I would like to enhance my page with features such as displaying additional parameters pulled via the weather API.  Also, adding additional data via API to display current fiat exchange rates and flight details would be interesting.
