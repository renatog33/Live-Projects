# Live Project
***
## Introduction
***
Toward the middle of my Software Developer Bootcamp at [The Tech Academy][ta], I participated in a two-week sprint with my peers.  Our project centered on building out applications
for an interactive website for managing one's collections related to various hobbies.  The project was built using the Django framework.

I created a Django application that allowed one to leave reviews for cryptocurrencies.  The stories consisted of building the basic app (base and home templates), creating a model, displaying all 
items (i.e., reviews from the database) in a page, creating a details page for each review, and adding edit and delete functions.

From the back-end perspective, the project also consisted of gathering API (#api-content) and Data Scraped content(#data-scraped-content).

Working with the Django framework gave me exposure to creating an application that leveraged HTML, CSS, Python, APIs, and Data Scraping.

### API Content
I created a page that displayed the live price of Bitcoin- the API call was made from [RapidAPI.com].[ra]

### Data Scraped Content
I created a page that data scraped elements (name, price, and market cap) of the top cryptocurrency by market cap from [Crypto.com].[cc]
